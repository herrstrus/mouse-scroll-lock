# Bash script - Linux
## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have ```xdotool``` installed on your system. ```xdotool``` is a command-line tool that is used to simulate key presses and mouse clicks. Here are the installation instructions for different operating systems:

### macOS
To install ```xdotool``` on macOS, you need to install XQuartz, which provides an X11 window system for macOS. You can then install ```xdotool``` using Homebrew by running the following command in the Terminal:
```bash
brew install xdotool
```

### Ubuntu/Debian
To install ```xdotool``` on Ubuntu/Debian, you can use the following command in the Terminal:
```bash
sudo apt-get install xdotool

```

### CentOS/RHEL
To install ```xdotool``` on Ubuntu/Debian, you can use the following command in the Terminal:
```bash
sudo yum install xdotool

```

## Usage
To run the script, open the Terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Then, run the following command:

Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x scrolllock.sh
```
Run the script
```bash
./scrolllock-toggle.sh
```
You can also pass two optional parameters to the script:

- sleep: Specifies the sleep time in seconds (default is 10 seconds).
- interval: Specifies the announcement interval in cycles (default is 10 cycles).

For example, to set the sleep time to 5 seconds and the announcement interval to 5 cycles, run the following command:
```bash
./scrolllock-toggle.sh --sleep 5 --interval 5
```

## Script output
The script will continuously toggle the Scroll Lock key and print elapsed time announcements at the specified interval. The announcements will be displayed in the terminal window.

Additional Notes
- The script can be paused or terminated by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal window.
- The script will automatically restart if it is terminated.

Please note:** The script is provided for educational purposes only and should not be used in production environments.

# Powershell script - Windows
## Usage
1. Open PowerShell on your Windows machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located using the cd command.
3. Run the following command to execute the script:
```powershell
.\script.ps1
```

You can also pass parameters to the script by adding them after the script name. For example, to pass the value ```10``` to the ```$sleep``` parameter and the value ```5``` to the ```$interval``` parameter, run the following command:
```powershell
.\script.ps1 -sleep 10 -interval 5
```

# Troubleshooting
The error ```failed creating new xdo instance``` can be caused by the lack of ```XQuartz``` on your macOS system. XQuartz is a free and open-source X11 server for macOS. It provides a compatibility layer that allows applications that are designed for X11 to run on macOS. The ```xdotool``` command used in the script requires XQuartz to function properly.

Without XQuartz installed, the xdotool command cannot communicate with the X server, which is necessary for simulating keyboard inputs. This will result in the error message ```failed creating new xdo instance```.

You can download XQuartz from the official website: https://www.xquartz.org/ or by the terminal:
```bash
curl https://www.xquartz.org/download/XQuartz-22.2.0.pkg -o XQuartz-22.2.0.pkg
```

Run the following command to install XQuartz:
```bash
open XQuartz-22.2.0.pkg
```
The logoff-login might be required to apply the changes.
Once XQuartz is installed, you should be able to run the script without encountering the error message.

### Additionaly in case when script is still not working
1. Make sure that XQuartz is running. You can start XQuartz by opening it from the Applications folder or by running the following command in the Terminal:
```bash
open -a XQuartz
```
2. Make sure that the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly. The DISPLAY variable tells xdotool which X11 display to use. You can set the DISPLAY variable by running the following command in the Terminal:
```bash
export DISPLAY=:0
```
